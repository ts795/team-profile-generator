## Description

This project generates a HTML file for a team. The user can enter information about each team member from the command line and a HTML file is generated based on the user's inputs. It was implemented using Bootstrap, HTML, node JS, the Jest npm package, and the inquirer npm package. A screencast recording can be found here that demonstrates the script.
